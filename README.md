Asynx
===========

Asynx is an asynchronous, non-deterministic, multithreaded implementation of Bitcoin SV client software.

What is Bitcoin SV?
---------------------

[Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io/) is the original Bitcoin. It is a
currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing
transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision) restores the original protocol and economic
system, allowing it to remain safely stable whilst enabling massive scaling.

What is Asynx?
--------------------

Asynx is the name of open-source software which enables the use of Bitcoin SV. 

The source code was originally based on the [Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io)
v0.1.0 alpha software project and is parallel developed to enable massive scaling.
