This is a Beta release, the purpose of which is to provide a preview of the code in response to requests from 
miners and pool operators. This release will undergo extensive testing and security audit before the final release in October.

What is Bitcoin Cash?
---------------------

[Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) is an experimental digital
currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing
transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from
the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017.
Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same
transaction history up until the split.

What is Asynx?
--------------------

Asynx is the name of open-source software which enables the use of Bitcoin Cash. 

The source code was originally based on the [Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io)
software project.
